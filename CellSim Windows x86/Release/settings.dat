# This template scenario encompasses all of the aspects of the mode that can be configured.
# Lines preceeded by '#' are ingored.
# To randomly disperse a colony across the screen in a diffuse fashion, set the 'startX' and 'startY' values to 0.
# Currently, E.coli cells MUST be defined in the [Colony] subsection first to ensure they attack C.diff cells.
#   (On bug list for future releases).
# Highly recommended that you DO NOT run in fullscreen initially, as it may lock the video driver due to 
# further work being required on the graphics compatibility checks.
# Runs fine on my Inspiron 1525, but fails to run fullscreen on my Acer.
#   (On bug list for future releases)
