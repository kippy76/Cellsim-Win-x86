CellSim 1.0 was developed during a project I took part in over the summer of 2012 called the iGEM competition. If you wish to find out more, check out our team's Wiki page at http://2012.igem.org/Team:Dundee. In summarising, the program is a cross platform cellular automata written in C++ that visualises the biological and mathematic models of our project. It demostrates the cellular interactions between genetically engineered E.Coli and Clostridium Difficile cells in accelerated time.

Screenshot animation of CellSim 1.0 The program is based around the MVC design pattern and simulates the following models:

* Cell Division Rates
* Strains
* Colony Size, Initial Positioning & Colouration
* Medium Flow Effects
* Mucus Wall Effects
* Time Calibrated Rendering
* Nutrient Availability, Supply & Absorption
* Low Nutrient Mitosis Suppression
